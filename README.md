## Project Title

**Build Your Own Private Cloud Using DevStack + Web App Deploy**

---

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a private cloud infrastructure using **DevStack** (an OpenStack development environment) to simulate real-world cloud features. Deploy a web application on the private cloud to demonstrate resource provisioning, management, and scalability within a controlled, self-hosted environment.

---

## DevStack Installation & Configuration

- Installed **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** on host system.
- Downloaded and configured **DevStack** environment.
- Configured OpenStack core services such as **Nova** (compute), **Neutron** (networking), **Glance** (image), **Keystone** (identity).
- Launched virtual instances to verify cloud environment.

---

## Web Application Overview

- Backend built with **Python Flask**, providing REST APIs for application logic.
- Frontend developed in **React.js** to create interactive user interfaces.
- Data persisted in **PostgreSQL** database.
- Application deployed inside DevStack VM to demonstrate cloud-based deployment.

---

## Deployment & Monitoring

- Web app deployed on private cloud VM using **Apache** web server.
- Configured **OpenStack Horizon Dashboard** to monitor and manage cloud resources.
- (Optional) Implemented resource monitoring with **Prometheus** and visualization via **Grafana**.

## Performance Analysis & Monitoring

### VM Resource Utilization Over Time

![Resource Utilization Graph](https://via.placeholder.com/700x350.png?text=CPU+and+RAM+Utilization+Graph)

_Figure 2: CPU and RAM utilization of VMs during app deployment._

- Initial CPU usage spikes during VM boot and app deployment.
- Stable usage observed during steady app operation.
- RAM utilization remains within allocated limits ensuring efficient resource management.

### Network Traffic Monitoring

_Figure 3: Network traffic analysis on private cloud during web app usage._

- Shows inbound/outbound data packets per second.
- Confirms efficient network bandwidth usage during peak requests.

### Cloud Resource Allocation Breakdown

| Resource Type | Percentage Allocated |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Compute (CPU) | 40%                 |
| Memory (RAM)  | 35%                 |
| Storage       | 15%                 |
| Network       | 10%                 |

## Scalability Testing

Simulated scaling of VMs using OpenStack’s compute scaling features. Increased VM instances from 1 to 5 to handle higher load.

| Number of VMs | Average Response Time (ms) |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| 1             | 450                        |
| 3             | 220                        |
| 5             | 150                        |

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                      | Solution                                   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| DevStack installation errors  | Followed official documentation, resolved dependency conflicts by updating packages |
| Network configuration issues  | Used OpenStack Neutron for flexible networking; set up VLAN segmentation |
| Web app deployment delays     | Containerized app using Docker to speed deployment and ensure consistency |
| Monitoring tool integration   | Configured Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards carefully to avoid resource overload |
